<div data-panel="content" data-max-columns="4">
      <div class="mosaic-grid-row row">
        <div class="mosaic-grid-cell mosaic-width-full mosaic-position-leftmost col-md-12">
          <div class="mosaic-tile movable removable                   mosaic-IRichText-text-tile">

<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>You are using a type provided by plone that uses archetypes and
you do not like a particular widget the archetypes has implemented for
the field.&#160; You need to make a custom widget only for that type.&#160;
Problem is that you cannot override the widget page template file,
because the type is registered with specifically that widget and
overriding won't work.&#160;</p>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160; To accomplish this task, you need to override the content type
definition and create a new widget that is based off the old widget.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<div id="parent-fieldname-text" class="plain kssattr-atfieldname-text kssattr-templateId-newsitem_view kssattr-macro-text-field-view inlineEditable">
<ol><li>Decide what widget you need to customize.&#160; In this case, I'm customizing the InAndOut widget for the Smart Folder Type.</li><li>Copy
the inandout.pt file(or widget page template file you are customizing)
from the Products/Archetypes/skins/widgets folder into your skins
directory and rename as needed.</li><li>Make customizations to widget page template file.</li><li>In
your install script you are going to need to override the value for the
"macro" attribute for the widget in the field of your schema that you
want to change.</li><li>Then
you'll need to re-register the content type(you'll need to look at the
content type definitely to do this most likely because you need to know
the field name).<br>
</li><li>In the case of the smart folder, it would look like this,</li></ol>
</div>

<pre>from Products.ATContentTypes.content.topic import ATTopic&#160;&#160;&#160; 
from Products.ATContentTypes.config import PROJECTNAME
from Products.ATContentTypes.content.base import registerATCT

topic_fields = ATTopic.schema.fields()

for field in topic_fields:
  if field.getName() == 'customViewFields':
    field.widget.macro = "my_inandout"

registerATCT(ATTopic, PROJECTNAME)</pre>
