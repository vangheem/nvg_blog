          <p>It's been a long time since I've made a blog post and this still I thought I'd try a webcast. Well, not really a webcast but a video demonstration of some of collective.plonetruegallery's features. collective.plonetruegallery was one of my first projects for plone and has matured over the years now with lots of help from the community.</p>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>New gallery display type integrations(supports 8 total now)</li>
<ul>
<li>galleria</li>
<li>nivo slider</li>
<li>nivo gallery</li>
<li>pikachoose</li>
<li>s3slider</li>
</ul>
<li>Better inline gallery support</li>
<li>Gallery portlet can now show full gallery(useful when using in conjunction with Content Well Portlets)</li>
<li>Products.Collage support</li>
</ul>
<p>Documentation for installation and installing different display types can be found on&#160;<a class="external-link" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.plonetruegallery">pypi</a> and&#160;<a class="external-link" href="http://plone.org/products/plone-true-gallery/">plone.org</a>.</p>
<p>The music choice doesn't quite fit for the video. Sorry folks, I didn't know what else would be appropriate. It's better than silence :)</p>
