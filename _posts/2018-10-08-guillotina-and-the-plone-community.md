Guillotina is a Python AsyncIO data framework Ramon Navarro Bosch and I
co-authored. For more details you can [check out the website](https://guillotina.io/)
or [visit the docs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/guillotina/).

The origin of the project stems out of the Plone CMS community. Guillotina tries
to take the best things from Plone but put them in the context modern web. The name
Guillotina is in reference to "headless" CMS. Guillotina is built to scale. Many
areas where Plone fails, it exceeds at, etc(this is not a discussion about
Guillotina vs Plone).


# Why Guillotina

Ramon and I have been doing Plone for quite a while. We've both been active in the
community and have loved using the project and getting to know and become friends
with the people there.

Guillotina spawned out of the desire to be able to use Plone in large-scale projects.
Ramon created a startup that tried to use zodb and Plone and it was failing at
very badly at multiple levels. Plone is old, difficult to work with, bloated and built
on technology that is not in line with the modern web. He needed a solution. He loved Plone. He loved the community. From that, the ideas that drove Guillotina spawned and he convinced
me of the goals to join him.

*More than anything*, Ramon and I wanted to build something that would give members
of the Plone community a mechanism to still do plone-like things and not have
to use traditional Plone. It was an effort for the community. It was a project
to live alongside Plone in the ecosystem to provide a more diverse toolset to
solve problems.


# Let the trolling begin

Some may have guessed(or maybe not), that the name Guillotina has become
somewhat a contentious issue for some in the community(maybe just an outspoken minority).

(just a sample)

This is simply in response to Ramon and I sharing that we gave a talk on Guillotina
to a meetup in Barcelona.

It did not stop there, he also blogged about the name(not going to link, you can google).

Not enough? He even reported us to the people running pypi to try and get us removed
and they won't issue trove classifiers to us because of his complaint.

Piling on: this years Plone conference is going on right now in Japan. Jim Fulton,
the author of the database Plone uses was one of the keynotes where he evidently
took multiple slides of his keynote to take shots specifically at Guillotina.
Why? No idea. It doesn't make much sense to me to attack a community project
on a keynote you were asked to do for the community. Maybe the slide's criticisms
are valid. But again, why then and there?


# What community?

This is from fellow community members.

Who does that?

What might be worse than the silence from fellow community members.
Very few plainly, publicly defended us.

(Side note, I wrote a [simple python tool](https://github.com/vangheem/twitter-analyzer)
to analyze your twitter account for trolls. It uses ML text analysis. Guess who
was identified as my top troll?)

One has to wonder why the hostility? Maybe it's a defensive mechanism. I'm not sure
but they are just eating their own.


# What is in a name?

I won't get into the details of the offensive naming in this post. I'll just add
a couple points:

1. If Guillotina is offensive, there are many more, worse names that need to be taken out all of the place.
2. No one in the community bothered to talk cordially about the issue to us. It was nothing but
hostility or passive agressive behavior.
3. Very few people took their time to defend us(fellow community members).


# Pushing us out

Look, the community is stagnant. CMS is boring. We were trying to provide a mechansim
for the community and evolve and grow differently.

*Reciprocity*: Steve McMahon, a fellow Plone community member, has talked about how open
source communities are built on the concept of reciprocity. Reciprocity isn't just
about code. It happens on many different levels and ways that people interact within
a community.

Unfortunately, this will in the end, just push us further and further out of the
community. The mechanism of reciprocity is lost on us.


# Point of all this

The reason I'm writing all this is because the frustrations have been piling
on for a while and I think the wider community might be interested in knowing
what is happening.

If we end up getting pushed out of the community, we'll be extremely sad but many
of our relationship and code will live on.
