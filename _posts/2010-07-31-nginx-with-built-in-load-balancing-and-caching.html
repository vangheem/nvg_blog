          <h2>Another Update</h2>
<p>I've received an angry email telling me that I should feel shame and I am misleading people because the specific example I give below does not work for them. First off, I never meant this to be a comprehensive example--I don't have time for that. Second of all, I thought it was obvious that the implementor would need to fill in some of the details. This is just an example of how it can be done--NOT a drop in replacement.</p>
<p>So, you may need to create cache directories, read some docs and customize some settings to get this going. Some effort is required on the implementor's end.</p>
<h2 style="padding-left: 0px;">Update</h2>
<p style="padding-left: 0px;">Some have commented that in using nginx to do your load balancing you lose session affinity since nginx won't send it's users to the same backend. This can hurt performance since each zeo client would potentially have to cache a single user's specific objects.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 0px;">If you find this to be a problem, there is a&#160;<a class="external-link" style="padding-left: 0px;" href="http://code.google.com/p/nginx-sticky-module/">sticky nginx module</a> that will handle this for load balancing. With this, each browser will be sent to the same backend.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Why muck around with HAProxy and Varnish when you can have nginx do it all for you. The setup is easy and it's a lot easier to maintain.</p>
<h2>Installing nginx with buildout</h2>
<p>You can setup nginx fairly easily with buildout. The only fancy part of our setup is that we're going to include the nginx cache purge module.</p>
<ol>
<li>Add the cache purge part to your buildout <br>
<pre>[ngx_cache_purge]
recipe = hexagonit.recipe.download
url = http://labs.frickle.com/files/ngx_cache_purge-1.1.tar.gz
strip-top-level-dir = true</pre>
</li>
<li>I needed the pcre source to compile also<br>
<pre>[pcre-source]
recipe = hexagonit.recipe.download
url = ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/pcre-8.00.tar.gz
strip-top-level-dir = true
</pre>
</li>
<li>and the nginx part<br>
<pre>[nginx-build]
recipe = hexagonit.recipe.cmmi
url = http://nginx.org/download/nginx-0.8.45.tar.gz
configure-options =
    --with-http_stub_status_module
    --conf-path=${buildout:directory}/settings/nginx.conf
    --error-log-path=${buildout:directory}/var/log/nginx-error.log
    --pid-path=${buildout:directory}/var/nginx.pid
    --lock-path=${buildout:directory}/var/nginx.lock
    --with-pcre=${pcre-source:location}
    --with-http_ssl_module
    --add-module=${ngx_cache_purge:location}
</pre>
</li>
<li>and finally, add it all to the parts directive<br>
<pre>parts =
    ...
    pcre-source
    ngx_cache_purge
    nginx-build
    ...

</pre>
</li>
<li>After you re-run buildout, you'll be able to run nginx by issuing a command like this:<br>
<pre>./parts/nginx/sbin/nginx -c /path/to/configuration/nginx.conf</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>nginx configuration</h2>
<p>Here is a simple sample configuration for nginx configured with load balancing and caching. It can obvious get as complicated as you want it, but I definitely think this is easier than managing haproxy, varnish and nginx.</p>
<pre>pid /path/to/buildout/var/nginx.pid;
lock_file /path/to/buildout/var/nginx.lock;

worker_processes 2;
daemon off;

 	# can specify multiple cache paths for different resources/paths/proxies
    # if needed..
    # the levels=1:2 just means it'll store the cache'd files 2 levels down in
    # the folder structure
    proxy_cache_path  /var/www/cache  levels=1:2 keys_zone=thecache:100m max_size=1000m inactive=600m;
