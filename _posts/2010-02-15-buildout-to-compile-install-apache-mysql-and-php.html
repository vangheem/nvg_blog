<p>I like to make my work environments contained and repeatable. <a class="external-link" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout">Buildout</a>&#160;is tool that can help you do that. While buildout is a python tool, with buildout recipes you can compile and install other types of applications relatively easily.&#160;</p>
<p>You can download <a title="Buildout files to install Apache, MySQL and PHP" class="internal-link" href="../files/buildout-amp.zip">my buildout here</a>. It also contains patches for it to work on Mac OS X. You'll need python installed for this to work.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with <a class="external-link" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout">buildout</a>, these are the steps to get it working after you've extracted it...</p>
<pre>python bootstrap.py
./bin/buildout</pre>
<p>Then wait for a long time. Then read the README.txt for instructions on how to configure and start apache</p>
