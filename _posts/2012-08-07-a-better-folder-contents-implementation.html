<div data-panel="content" data-max-columns="4">
      <div class="mosaic-grid-row row">
        <div class="mosaic-grid-cell mosaic-width-full mosaic-position-leftmost col-md-12">
          <div class="mosaic-tile movable removable                   mosaic-IRichText-text-tile">
          <div class="mosaic-tile-content">
          <p>We've found that many of our clients have trouble with the default drag and drop plone offers. Additionally, it's often asked for a multi-file uploader.</p>
<p>wildcard.foldercontents is the packing of various different features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better drag and drop based off of jQuery UI sortable</li>
<li>uploadify multi-file uploads based off of collective.uploadify</li>
<li>automatic folder sorting--idea stolen from collective.sortmyfolder</li>
</ul>
