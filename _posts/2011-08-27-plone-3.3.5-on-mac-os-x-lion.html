          <h2>Getting Python 2.4</h2>
<p>First off, make sure you have a version of python 2.4 installed on the system. If you use the one located in the svn collective, it has a few patches that make it work correctly with Lion.</p>
<pre>svn co http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/buildout/python/<br>cd python<br>python bootstrap.py<br>./bin/buildout&#160;</pre>
<p>Then use that python with your buildout.</p>
<h2>Beware of collective.xdv</h2>
<p>I didn't have enough time to figure out why, but xdv was making my instance crash on startup with no explanation. I did get plone to startup by upgrading to the latest version of xdv and collective.xdv but it would still crash when rendering a page for me. For now, I've just disable xdv on Lion and at least for a working plone 3 dev machine.</p>
<p>Small post but I just wanted to put it up in case someone else was experiencing the same problems.</p>
