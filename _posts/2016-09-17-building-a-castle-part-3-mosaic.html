          <p>Mosaic is great for content editors to have more control over the look and feel of their site. Mosaic is a central piece in what we are doing with Castle as we're removed all traditional content editing and replaced it with Mosaic.</p>
<h2>Mosaic editor enabled by default</h2>
<p>With plone.app.mosaic, OOTB to edit your content with mosaic you:</p>
<ol>
<li>click to add content</li>
<li>click save</li>
<li>select mosaic&#160;display</li>
<li>click edit</li>
<li>select mosaic layout</li>
<li>now you are editor</li>
</ol>
<p>With Castle, we streamlined that process.&#160;Things mosaic does:</p>
<ul>
<li>every content type is mosaic enabled</li>
<li>we've setup default mosaic content layouts for each type so you start editing immediately</li>
<li>with our implementation&#160;of the&#160;add content form, it means your editors can start editing content immediately</li>
</ul>

<h2>Consistency</h2>
<p>It's important to provide users a consistent way to interact with the system and less choices to have to deal with.</p>
<p>Using this approach, we were able to get rid of default page--one of the most confusing things to try and teach content editors about Plone.</p>
<p>We also no longer have a display menu. Anything that would go under display is either moved to a mosaic pre-defined layout or the user is expected to be able to build.</p>
<p>In doing this, we were able to get rid of 2 confusing aspects of Plone and provide a more consistent editing experience.</p>
