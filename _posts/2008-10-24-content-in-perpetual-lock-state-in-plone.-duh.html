description: If you ever have an issue where content can't be unlocked no matter what you do, you might want to look at portal_migration in the ZMI.  You may have forgotten to upgrade your site.

<div data-panel="content" data-max-columns="4">
      <div class="mosaic-grid-row row">
        <div class="mosaic-grid-cell mosaic-width-full mosaic-position-leftmost col-md-12">
          <div class="mosaic-tile movable removable                   mosaic-IRichText-text-tile">
          <div class="mosaic-tile-content">
          
<p>Basically, if any of your content just won't unlock, make sure you've run any possible portal_migration steps in the ZMI of your plone instance.&#160;</p>
